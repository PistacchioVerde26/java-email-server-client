# Email Client/Server - Java
Project for the university exam of advanced programming in Java

This project was developed in total autonomy for the practical part of the exam Programmazione III (advanced java programming) of the Computer Science course at UniTO in 2018.

The final products were to be an email server that manages emails account and a client UI to send and receive emails. The data were to be stored as files, no DB admitted, and the communication between client and server was to be managed by RMI or Sockets, i choose the latter.
The UI for the client was developed using JavaFX meanwhile for the server, given the simplicity of it's UI, was developed with Swing.
Also, a strict MVC pattern was to be followed in order to pass the exam.

With this final project i got a mark of 30.
